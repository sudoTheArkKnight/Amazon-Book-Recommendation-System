# Amazon Book Recommendation System

## Overview

This project aims to build an end-to-end book recommendation system using the [Amazon Books Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chhavidhankhar11/amazon-books-dataset). The system will recommend books to users based on their preferences and behavior, leveraging advanced recommendation algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information about Amazon book reviews. The dataset includes:

- Book titles
- Authors
- Average ratings
- Review counts
- Categories
- Additional metadata

## Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
- **Model Selection**: Implement and compare various recommendation algorithms including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.
- **Model Training**: Train the recommendation models on the dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the models using metrics such as RMSE, precision, and recall.
- **Deployment**: Develop a user interface or API for users to interact with the recommendation system.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-book-recommendation-system.git
    cd amazon-book-recommendation-system
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download the dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chhavidhankhar11/amazon-books-dataset) and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Data Exploration**:[README.md](README.md)
    Run the[README.md](README.md) Jupyter Notebook in `notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb` to explore and preprocess the data.

2. **Model Training**:
    Execute the scripts in `src/recommendation_models.py` to train the recommendation models.

3. **Evaluation**:
    Use `src/evaluation.py` to evaluate the performance of the models.

4. **Run the Application** (if applicable):
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
